# Project Insights
🔎 Funnel Performance Analysis

The dashboard shows strong top-of-funnel performance with 216K impressions and 25.4K clicks, resulting in a high 11.76% CTR, indicating effective ad creatives and targeting.

Engagement rate is also strong at 13.56%, showing good audience interaction. However, only 1.3K purchases were generated, leading to a 5.21% conversion rate (from clicks) and 0.61% purchase rate (from impressions).

Specific dates show spikes, likely tied to promotions or campaign launches.

➡️ Insight: Budget allocation should prioritize high-performing hours and event-based campaigns to maximize ROI.
